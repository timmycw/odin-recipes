<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken. This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using
pork cutlets instead of chicken. Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Chicken </li>
    <li>Seasonings </li>
    <li>Flour </li>
    <li>Egg</li>
    <li>Panko</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate
    shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs
    until well coated on both sides.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4
    minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
</ol>
